## Overview

This age calculator app allows users to check how old they are with precision to years, months and days after submitting a valid birthday date.

### The challenge

Users are able to:
- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form.
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted.
  - The day number is not between 1-31.
  - The month number is not between 1-12.
  - The year or the date in general is in the future.
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- See the age numbers animate to their final number once the form is submitted.
